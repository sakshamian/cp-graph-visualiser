# Graph Visualizer - VS Code Extension

A powerful Visual Studio Code extension designed for competitive programmers to visualize and test graph problems. Transform your nodes and edges input into beautiful, interactive graph visualizations with zero-indexed adjacency representation.

## üåü Features

- **Easy Graph Input**: Simple node and edge input format
- **Zero-Indexed Graphs**: Generates 0-indexed adjacency representation perfect for competitive programming
- **Visual Graph Display**: Interactive graph visualization within VS Code
- **Undirected Graph Support**: Currently supports undirected graphs with planned support for directed graphs
- **Competitive Programming Focused**: Designed with competitive programmers in mind
- **Lightweight**: Minimal performance impact on your VS Code environment

## üì¶ Installation


## üöÄ Usage


## üìã Requirements

- Visual Studio Code version 1.74.0 or higher
- No additional dependencies required

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

- [ ] **Directed Graph Support**: Add support for directed graphs with arrow indicators
- [ ] **Weighted Edges**: Support for edge weights visualization
- [ ] **Algorithm Visualization**: Step-by-step algorithm execution (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra)
- [ ] **Multiple Graph Formats**: Support for adjacency matrix input
- [ ] **Graph Templates**: Pre-built graph templates for common problems
- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: Display graph properties (diameter, density, etc.)
- [ ] **Theme Support**: Dark/light theme compatibility
- [ ] **Export Formats**: Support for multiple export formats (SVG, PNG, JSON)
